## WELCOME TO SwiftCart E-Commerce Website

SwiftCart is a simple and responsive e-commerce website built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and vanilla JavaScript. It fetches product and category data from an external API and displays them dynamically across multiple pages. The project focuses on clean UI design, mobile responsiveness, and practical DOM manipulation concepts.



1. ** What is the difference between null and undefined? ** 
In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value yet. On the other hand, null means the programmer has intentionally assigned an empty or “no value” state to a variable.

2.  ** What is the use of the map() function in JavaScript? How is it different from forEach()? ** 
In JavaScript, the map() function is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array. It returns the transformed array without changing the original one.
The forEach() function is used to execute a function on each element of an array, but it does not return a new array. It is mainly used for performing actions like logging, updating variables, or side effects rather than transforming data.


3. ** What is the difference between == and ===? ** 
In JavaScript, == compares two values after converting them to the same type (type coercion), so values like 5 and "5" are considered equal. In contrast, === compares both the value and the data type without any type conversion, so 5 and "5" are not equal.

4. **  What is the significance of async/await in fetching API data? ** 
The significance of async/await in fetching API data is that it makes asynchronous code easier to read and write by allowing it to look and behave like synchronous code. It helps handle promises more cleanly, improves error handling with try/catch, and avoids deeply nested callbacks.

5. ** Explain the concept of Scope in JavaScript (Global, Function, Block). ** 
In JavaScript, scope determines where variables can be accessed in a program. Global scope means a variable declared outside any function can be accessed from anywhere in the code. Function scope means variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function. Block scope applies to variables declared with let and const, where they are only accessible inside a block such as {} in loops or conditional statements.
